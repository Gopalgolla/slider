    <h3 >What Can SQL do?
        SQL can execute queries against a database
        SQL can retrieve data from a database
        SQL can insert records in a database
        SQL can update records in a database
        SQL can delete records from a database
        SQL can create new databases
        SQL can create new tables in a database
        SQL can create stored procedures in a database
        SQL can create views in a database
        SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views
        SQL is a Standard - BUT....
        Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
        
        However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.
        
        Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!
        
        Using SQL in Your Web Site
        To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:
        
        An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
        To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
        To use SQL to get the data you want
        To use HTML / CSS to style the page</h3>
