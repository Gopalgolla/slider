                    <strong>React JS & Angular</strong>React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM. React only changes what needs to be changed! React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed. You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutorial. React.JS History Current version of React.JS is V18.0.0 (April 2022). Initial Release to the Public (V0.3.0) was in July 2013. React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature. Facebook Software Engineer, Jordan Walke, created it. Current version of create-react-app is v5.0.1 (April 2022). create-react-app includes built tools such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint.</a>.

                    <strong>SQL database</strong>What Can SQL do? SQL can execute queries against a database SQL can retrieve data from a database SQL can insert records in a database SQL can update records in a database SQL can delete records from a database SQL can create new databases SQL can create new tables in a database SQL can create stored procedures in a database SQL can create views in a database SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views SQL is a Standard - BUT.... Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language. However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner. Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard! Using SQL in Your Web Site To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need: An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL) To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP To use SQL to get the data you want To use HTML / CSS to style the page</a>.

                    <strong>Python programming language</strong>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting. What can Python do? Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. Why Python? Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way. Good to know The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. </a>.
