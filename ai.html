    <h3>Generative AI is an AI that can create something like:

        Text
        Images
        Audio
        Videos
        3D models
        Generative AIs analyze and use existing data and input from a user to generate these things.
        
        Giving Generative AIs input is known as AI Prompt Writing or AI Prompt Engineering.
        
        What is AI Prompt Writing?
        AI Prompt Writing (or Engineering) is the process of creating input (usually text) instructing the Generative AI to generate the desired response.
        
        In other words, prompting is the way we ask an AI to do something.
        
        A prompt should be tailored to the type of response you want to receive and to the specifics of the Generative AI you use.
        
        Different types of prompts:
        
        Instructions
        Questions
        Data
        Examples</h3>
